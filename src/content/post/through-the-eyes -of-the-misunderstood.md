I've already racked up around 50 hours of teaching since last semester when we first started the internship.

Of the five sections that my teacher is assigned to, there is this one student who stood out.

## Introducing Joshua Gumaygay

Most of the time, when a student stands out, it is because they are excelling in class. He, however, is different. I can't say either that he is on the other side of the spectrum.

I don't want to say this but Joshua stands out like a sore thumb. (At least that's how his classmates describe him.) He is a menace. He doesn't stay still in his seat, he randomly puts up fights, he tries to get people's attentions, and he does a lot more. He is next level.

His section was my very first teaching opportunity. The class went well, but he tested the limits of my patience. 

He transfers seats every few minutes, chats with the other student, transfer seats or stands, chats, you  get it.
